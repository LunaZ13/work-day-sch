# Work Day Scheduler

## Discription: 
I was tasked with creating a daily planner that diplays the current day at the top. It should display time blocks for standard business hours for the day. The user is then able to create events that are saved and are able to be edited. The blocks are also color coded to show events that are past, present, or future.

## Installation:
Open in browser or click on the following link. https://lunaz13.github.io/work-day-sch/

Instructions - The user is able to see the day and time displayed at the top of the screen. To start, the user can input text in the text-area box and click on the save button at the far right of the row. If the user wishes to edit the text; they can just click in the text box, make their desired changes, and then click the save button again. The time blocks will also be color coded as time passes. Grey will mean event is past, red will mean event is present, and green will mean event is in the future.
